# ulaughulose
A game that detects emtions. I want this game to detect laughs after a person watches a funny video throughe a minimum sound detection and facial recognition.


Currently a work in progress. I got it to a work a little. The model being used right now is not mine and it does not seem ot work very well  cause I have to resize every frame before processing.   
Will probably train my own model.   

## What I have done so far?   
Using this [face recognion library](https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) and this [model](https://github.com/priya-dwivedi/face_and_emotion_detection), I am trying to create a laughter detection mechanism. This model works, but is not that greate for emotion detection and needs to be recreated to detect laughs and stuff.
