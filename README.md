# ulaughulose
A game that detects emtions. I want this game to detect laughs after a person watches a funny video through a minimum sound detection and facial recognition.


Currently a work in progress. I got it to a work a little. The model being used right now is not mine and it does not seem ot work very well  cause I have to resize every frame before processing.   
Will probably train my own model.
